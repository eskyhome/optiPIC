General-purpose computing on graphics processing units, GPGPU, is a recent trend in parallel computing. With hundreds
or thousands of threads on a single device, it offers massive parallelism at a relatively low cost.

Nvidia's parallel computing environment CUDA is one of the leading GPGPU technologies. This project has
implemented a Particle-In-Cell code using CUDA and the cuFFT library. The PIC method is a technique for solving
partial differential equations, and are used to simulate the behavior of charged particles.

The different steps of the simulation algorithm have been timed for different combinations of simuilation grid resolution
and particle numerosity. Based on the results from these benchmarks we determine bottlenecks and issues with the
implementation, and give suggestions for optimizations.
